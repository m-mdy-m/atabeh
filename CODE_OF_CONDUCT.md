# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

Atabeh exists to help people navigate internet connectivity challenges, often in regions where access is restricted or unreliable. This mission requires a community built on respect, collaboration, and shared purpose. We're committed to making participation in this project a welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of who they are or where they come from.

## Standards We Uphold

**What we encourage:**

- Approaching discussions with genuine curiosity and good faith
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences, especially around technical decisions
- Offering and accepting constructive feedback gracefully
- Taking responsibility when we make mistakes and learning from them
- Focusing on what's best for the project and its users
- Supporting other contributors, especially those who are new

**What we don't accept:**

- Harassment, intimidation, or discriminatory language or behavior
- Personal attacks, trolling, or deliberately inflammatory comments
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Spam, advertising, or other commercial exploitation of the project
- Any conduct that creates an unsafe or unwelcoming environment

## Scope

This code applies in all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, discussions, and any official communication channels. It also applies when representing the project in public spaces, whether online or in person.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this code, please report it by contacting the project maintainers. You can do this through:

- Opening a private security advisory on GitHub
- Emailing the maintainers directly (contact information in the repository)
- Reaching out through official project communication channels marked for conduct issues

All reports will be reviewed and investigated with appropriate confidentiality. The maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of anyone who reports an incident.

## What Happens Next

Depending on the severity and context of the violation, responses may include:

**Minor issues**: A private conversation to clarify expectations and resolve misunderstandings

**Moderate issues**: A formal warning with clear explanation of what needs to change

**Serious issues**: Temporary suspension from project participation

**Severe or repeated violations**: Permanent removal from the project community

We're not interested in wielding these measures arbitrarily. The goal is always to foster a healthy community, not to exclude people. Most issues can be resolved through honest conversation, and we'll always try that first.

## Context Matters

This project operates in a space where internet freedom and privacy are real concerns for real people. Conversations here might touch on topics like censorship, surveillance, or government restrictions. We understand that people come to these discussions with different perspectives shaped by their experiences.

We expect everyone to engage with these topics thoughtfully and respectfully. Disagreement about approaches or solutions is fine and even healthy. What's not acceptable is dismissing others' experiences or concerns as invalid simply because they differ from your own.

## Technical Disagreements

Building software involves constant decision-making with trade-offs. We'll have debates about architecture, implementation details, supported protocols, and project direction. These disagreements are natural and valuable.

When discussing technical matters:

- Back up your positions with reasoning and evidence when possible
- Acknowledge the trade-offs in different approaches
- Remember that "I prefer X" is different from "X is objectively better"
- Accept that maintainers sometimes make final calls even when consensus isn't reached
- Don't conflate technical disagreement with personal conflict

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, with modifications to better fit the specific context and needs of the Atabeh project.

## Living Document

Communities evolve, and so should their guidelines. If you have suggestions for improving this Code of Conduct, open an issue or pull request. We're open to refinement as we learn what works best for our community.

The goal here is simple: make Atabeh a project where people feel comfortable contributing their skills and ideas toward building something useful. If we're all working toward that, we're probably doing fine.
